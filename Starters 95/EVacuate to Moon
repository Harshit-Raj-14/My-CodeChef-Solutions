NOTE - THE REASON TO TYPECAST h to long in multiplication is so becuase if we did not do it, the multiplication would have returned int leading to lossy conversion
THE BETTER THING TO HANDLE THESE KIND OF SITUATION SIS TO TAKE EVERYTHING AS LONG IN INPUT. (THIS ACTUALLY WORKED WHEN TRIED)
REMEMBER THIS



LOGIC ---
If you have HH hours, what’s the maximum total power that can be charged?
Each car can use at most one charger, each charger can charge at most one car.

EXPLANATION:

Let K=min⁡(N,M)K=min(N,M).
Certainly, we can only use at most KK outlets, and charge at most KK cars.

Since only K outlets can be used, it makes sense to take the best K of them, i.e, the K highest Bi​ values.
Similarly, it makes sense to take the cars with most capacity - the K largest Ai​ values.

These can be found by sorting the array in descending order.
It’s not hard to see that it’s best to match the best outlet to the highest-capacity car, the second best outlet to the second highest-capacity car, and so on.
