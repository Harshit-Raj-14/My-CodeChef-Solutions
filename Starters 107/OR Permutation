/*
LOGIC---
Objective: Form an array such that : a[i] != a[i-1] | a[i-2]

BASIC RULE OF OR : When you OR two things their value is greater than their own.
a|b=x => x>a,b as long as a!=b

Since, a1 a2 a3 exist in sequence and are not equal;
if we have: a1<a2<a3
to make sure a[i] != a[i-1] | a[i-2]
We would want that a[i] should be less than either of a[i-1], a[i-2]

So, if 1,2,3 => 1,3,2 or, 2,3,1 or, 3,2,1 can be our answers

Henc eif we just reverse print n->1 this will be our answer.
As a[i-1] | a[i-2] will always produce a greater value but our a[i] by reversing the series becoems smaller.
