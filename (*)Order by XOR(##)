LOGIC -
Find X to fulfill ocndition : (A⊕X)<(B⊕X)<(C⊕X)

Case I : Numbers already sorted
eg : 1 2 3
if X=0
we already know that  a^0 = a
So, we got our condition fulfilled.

Case II:
eg : 3 2 1
if X=3
Binary form for a,b,c : 11 10 01
X = 3 = 11
Binary form(a,b,c^X) == 00 01 10 == 0 1 2
So, we got our condition fulfilled.
